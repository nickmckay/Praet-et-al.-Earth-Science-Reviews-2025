# Praet-et-al.-Earth-Science-Reviews-2025
Code for age modelling and related figures for Praet et al. 2025 "Refining the earthquake history of south-central Alaska through lake records" 

To run the model, use `varveModelv_SkilakOrig.R`.

To conduct subsequent analysis and create the related figures run `ProcessModelOutputAndFigures.R`

*Disclaimer:* This codebase is not particularly well organized or commented, but should run. The varve model is computationally expensive, and will take awhile to run. If you run into problems, please post an issue and I'll try to help you get it resolved.
